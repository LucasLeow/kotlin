Test-Driven Development
===========================================================================================

    - write test case before implementation of function (only for unit tests)


    Steps:
        1. Write function signature (without body)
        2. Write test cases for that function (test cases should all fail initially)
        3. Write function logic so that all tests passes
    
    * best case is to only have 1 assertion per test case
        - sometimes may require multiple assertions, its fine
    
    * never make the outcome of a test dependent on the outcome of another test


===========================================================================================
What makes a good test case
===========================================================================================

    1. Scope    
        - how much code is covered in test case
    2. Speed
        - how fast test case run
    3. Fidelity
        - how realistic a test is to a real scenario

    * Wants to prevent flaky tests (sometimes succeeds, sometimes fails)

===========================================================================================
How many test case to write
===========================================================================================

    - As little as necessary but sufficient to cover all cases
